Welcome to Not Doom!


This project was create by Jacob Franco, Jacob Sellers, and Cristian DePalm.

This game is based off the retro game Doom.

To play the game download the repository or download the .zip file from github.
The project should run once the game has been compiled and the world is loaded. 

Some things to help make the game run and look more complete.
1. Select the directional light component in the world and change it to static.
2. Select the MazeBuilder_BP and type ceiling in the search and click build ceiling instances.
3. While in MazeBuilder_BP type in Doors and select build door instances. Set this to false as the doors do not have physics attached to them
4. If you would like to change the style of the game up a little bit change openness in the Maze to 90 instead of 45 this will make the area alot smaller.

Notable bugs in the game
1. Characters may still attack after they are dead. This is a bug with the AI 
2. Why is the maze dark after I built the ceilings (Refer to the above section)
3. There is no end of game feature as we did not get that far. You will find another set of stairs that leads you out of the maze. This is our end of game area!

Please let us know of any bugs in the game.

Thanks for playing :)
